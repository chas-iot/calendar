# calendar

Provides calendar management of the working week, holidays, and other event dates.
This is to support rules such as not switching on a wakeup alarm on public or personal holidays, or triggering an automatic light display on a birthday.

Currently, this has optional use of the Calendarific.com holiday API. I would like to add at least one more holiday API.
