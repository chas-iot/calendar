# calendar

Provides calendar management of the working week, holidays, and other event dates.
This is to support rules such as not switching on a wakeup alarm on public or personal holidays, or triggering an automatic light display on a birthday.

Currently, this has optional use of the calendarific.com or the date.nager.at holiday APIs.

Please treat free API sources as an input aid rather than a reliable source of holiday data. Some governments do change public holidays at short notice.
The API provider may not be able to keep up with these changes or may choose to not publish these changes to their free tier users.
